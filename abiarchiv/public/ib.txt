Dearest IB students,<split>Some of the things I meant but forgot to tell you. Or possibly that I, being an older person, forgot I already told you: Magic words in every place and from every perspective: please, thank you, sorry, help.<split>Make room for CAS in your life. It's easier and more rewarding than you think.<split>"Make new friends but keep the old." It's harder and more rewarding than you think.<split>Find and mentor younger people.<split>Wear your helmet, even on good hair days.<split>"From everyone to whom much was given, much will be expected." So shake it and share it, gifted people.<split>Celebrate the efforts and accomplishments of others. 15 points!<split>If the music is good, you'd better be on the dance floor. (May also be used as a metaphor.)<split>When in doubt, take the risk. If it isn't scary, it ain't much of a risk.<split>Don't be afraid to talk to stuffed animals.<split>I wish for you a life full of grace, of doing more than you must, of successfully dodging dodgy supervisors and occasionally meeting "deadlines" on time. I wish you a life of intellectual curiosity, service to others and the courage to look into black holes with the same bravado you showed here. Thank you for asking the right questions and for inspiring me again and again.<split>Stay in touch.<split>Much love,<split>Laura
